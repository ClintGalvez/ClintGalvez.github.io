About Me

.about__description
I'm a 4th year Computer Science student from Carleton University.
I'm pretty laidback but I live for the challenge. As for my interests,
besides the obvious game dev and everything related,
I enjoy calisthenics, rock-climbing, muay thai, reading, and eldritch horrors.

My Skills

.skills__description
I'm very familiar and comfortable with Object Oriented Programming
and working in an Agile environment on various projects both independently 
and with a team (multi-disciplinary or not). 

Since I'm a fast learner, I'm especially 
good at adapting to the tasks at hand and doing what it takes to get the
job done; whether it be performing independent research or working
collaboratively with others.
